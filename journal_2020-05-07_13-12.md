Fluidity and its Presence in My Group Project in the Midst of Remote Learning

Throughout this course we’ve learned about the concept of fluidity and its meaning in regard to fluid texts, including Walden by Henry David Thoreau. Interestingly and ironically enough, we have learned that fluidity applies to not only the digital humanities and corresponding literary world, but also to the world we live in as well. In the midst of this pandemic, I especially have come to truly understand the power and presence of fluidity in our everyday lives. Humans tend to resist fluidity as abrupt changes throw us off from what we may individually desire. But, now more than ever, I have come to realize that no matter how hard one resists, fluidity is always going to be in our lives. The world is ever-changing and so are we as humans along with our lives. 

I’ve come to embrace fluidity over the time I’ve spent at home during this period of remote learning. This new and abrupt change has allowed me a time of self-reflection of not only the world around me, but also in response to the presence of fluidity in my learning and growth as a student who is not able to be physically present inside classroom walls. 

Group projects have always been stressful for me. I felt as if I had bad luck when it came to them, because I was frequently stuck with group members who didn’t wish to put equal effort, or any, into our project. When I learned that we would follow the original syllabus in regards to a final group project in Digital Humanities, I wouldn’t be lying if I said I was upset at the news. However, I was prepared to make the most of it and contribute my fair share to this ‘community effort.’ 

Thankfully, my group consisted of members who were present and engaging students as myself. Although it would’ve been much easier and preferable if we were all still at school and working on the project in a physical short distance from one another, my new perspective of fluidity in our everyday lives, inspired me to make the most out of what we had. Despite this challenge, we all were able to successfully come together as a single unit and equally distribute parts to each member to contribute to the collective project as a whole. Although we are not finished with the project yet, I have a new sense of faith in this group project and others in general. Fluidity has taught me one crucial thing: Life is not perfect. Each and every one of us will run into obstacles every now and then. But, what is important is the fact that we should all embrace fluidity, especially the state our world is in today instead of resisting it. Despite the last half of my second semester as a sophomore being taken away from me, I know that life will go on. It’s up to each of us to develop this new perspective on life.
