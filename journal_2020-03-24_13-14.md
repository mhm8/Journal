How to push my journal files to GitHub:

FIRST: the first step in pushing my journal files to GitHub is typing, "cd Documents Journal"
'ls'= showing all my documents in "Journal"
Typing 'git status' into my terminal= shows all my journal files- those that are tracked/untracked...untracked files will appear in red
Untracked files are the ones that need to be pushed to GitHub

Add + Commit + Push Routine= pushing my journal files successfully to GitHub

Add= takes a "snapshot" of my journal file... Type, "git add"...start to type journal, but can press tab and hopefully the name of my journal file will appear...press enter
Ex: git add journal_2020-03-24_13-14.md

Commit= Type, "git commit -m"... and in quotations something about my journal file, such as "added new journal file" to explain what I'm doing 
Ex: git commit -m "added new journal file"

Push= Type, "git push origin master"... This pushes my journal file to Github

If I need to make any changes to my journal file that I've pushed/add new content, I need to 1) Save my file again in Visual Code, and then do the Add, Commit, Push process all over again to make sure Github receives those changes I've made
