“Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity, and I may say innocence, with nature herself. I have been as sincere a worshipper of Aurora as the Greeks.” (P15: Walden- Where I Lived, And What I Lived For)

Fluid Edition of Walden:

"Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity, and purity with itself Nature herself. The morning is to every one the season of his ideal life. Then, if ever, we can realize the life of the Greeks—and we are all at some time good heathens enough to acknowledge and worship their Aurora."

My Commentary on these changes made:

The beginning of this paragraph was significantly shortened with Thoreau explaining his appreciation and excitement for every morning. In the fluid text edition, he initially states: “The morning is to every one the season of his ideal life. Then, if ever, we can realize the life of the Greeks and we are all at some time good heathens enough to acknowledge and worship their Aurora.” These two sentences were cut, and so he immediately jumps to describing himself as a worshipper of Aurora like the Greeks. Aurora is the ancient Roman version of Eos, the Ancient Greek goddess of the dawn. With these two sentences, Thoreau delves into a deeper description of his connection to the Greeks and the morning. My thoughts regarding this change is that he might have cancelled these two sentences due to the fact that he wanted to put greater emphasis on his appreciation of every coming morning instead of his worshipping relationship with the Greeks.

It's interesting to see how large of a difference the cancellation of two sentences is regarding what Thoreau is trying to get across to his readers. Not only that, but it's interesting to see the progression into what his final work is now, and to see the changes he made along the way due to the fluid text edition that is available to us.
