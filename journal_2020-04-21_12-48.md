Notes on TEI:

There are various terms/vocabulary to describe parts of texts
Ex. title, title page, chapter, heading, subheading, line, stanza, etc.

We learn these terms at an early age at the beginning of when we learn how to read at a young age, and don’t really give them any thought or analysis.
Have we ever thought of these terms as “constituting a specialized vocabulary,” otherwise known as a ‘metalanguage?’ No.

One form of metalanguage= TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)
- TEI (the metalanguage) is an example of XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
Difference between TEI and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
- HTML is also a metalanguage, but has a different purpose; it enables web browsers, such as Safari and Chrome “to deliver a properly formatted document to your device screen”

However, TEI is not involved in formatting. It’s main purpose is to make statements about a text.
- One use of TEI is to translate the familiar language of visual display (what we see of a text, i.e. chapters, paragraphs, lines, etc.) into a language of symbols
