Concepts To Review Surrounding ENGL 340:

This semester the majority of our discussions have revolved around the significance of  reading in the humanities, and correspondingly the invention of writing seen as a means of technology for transmitting and receiving information
At first, it can be difficult to think of literature as a type of information (this was personally the case for me; for me, I always categorized information in a technical and scientific aspect, outside the realm of reading and the humanities)
However, we need to get past the barrier of tending to always compartmentalize information within the “scientific,” “news,” or “data” aspect. 

Varieties of Reading:

Close reading= the careful “identification of meaningful patterns in a text” (ie. diction, imagery, structure, tone) in order to develop interpretations of the text itself, the author, etc.

Hyperreading= reading less for the purpose of gathering meanings or interpretations of a text, or more for the need to “quickly locate relevant information across multiple sources” (this could be reflective of a time crunch, to save time, or to gather as much information as possible in an efficient manner)

Machine reading= “for a type of reading that relies on the power of computation,” a.k.a. Distant reading, to find “meaningful patterns across a corpus that may contain thousands of texts

***Metareading: When we’re looking to say something about a text, regardless of any type of genre we’re looking at
Ex. an attempt to locate the author of a given text who remains anonymous, and who nobody knows exactly for sure
