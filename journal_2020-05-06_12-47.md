Thoughts on My Participation in the Final Project:

Today, I completed the first half of transcribing the first half of manuscript page 139 from Walden’s Version B into a TEI file. Although the process was fairly straight-forward for me since our class has already had practice with editing a TEI file, it still required a lot of patience and attention to detail on my part. I spent most of my effort attempting to read the (quite messy) cursive of Thoreau’s original manuscript page of Version B, and translating it into the TEI file in VS Code. As for transcribing the words from the manuscript page into the metalanguage of a TEI file, it required a lot of trial and error, in which I thought I was done, but when I went to validate the file there was still an error. Therefore, it’s important to take your time with this process because something can easily be overlooked. What I appreciated the most out of this experience was the level of concentration I needed for this. It was quite easy to immerse myself within this process and become very focused.

In relation to Walden, I found a much more deeper sense of appreciation for the creation and development of it on Henry David Thoreau's part. The finished product always makes itself available to people like us in society. Therefore, it can be quite easy to overlook and not acknowledge the time, effort, dedication, and passion authors like Thoreau put into their work.
