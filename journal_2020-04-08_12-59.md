Practice: Using manuscript images in a timeline

When creating and publishing a timeline in TimelineJS for Gleick's The Information, the simple way to include an image in the timeline was to copy and paste the web address of the image file. However, in this current excercise we've learned how to paste an image of a given page from Walden into VS Code to display in whatever way we wish.

IIIF Images (International Image Interoperability Framework)
- Many manuscript images are available on the web using this 'standard'
- When images are a part of this server, we can do much more than just copying and pasting the original version into VS Code
- We are able to bring a IIIF-compliant image into a web page or another application that can re-size the image, crop it, rotate it, etc. using IIIF API (Application Programming Interface) 
- We are able to use this type of technology with selecting a page from Walden and altering it in any way. In this case, I selected page 34 (randomly) from Walden and altered it so that the final image was 10% the size of the original.

How did I do this?

1. Copy + Paste the original URL of the image into VS Code-- this was the full-sized version
- reading the URL from right to left (backwards) we can see that it says "full/full" in it, meaning that this is the full-size image
2. To change this, delete the URL (backwards) so that we can re-insert "/full/pct:10/" into it, replacing "full/full"-- this is the URL for 10% of the original sized version
3. To see this change in VS Code, we need to use this process:
![Page 34 of *Walden* Version A] *** with the URL in parentheses next to the last bracket
4. Click "Preview" and hopefully we are able to see the image in 10% of its original size.
