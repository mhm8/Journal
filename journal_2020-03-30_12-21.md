“Fluid Text”

= A text who’s meaning can’t be fully understood apart from its “textual history”

Ultimately, literacy in general should be seen as something fluid
Dictionary meaning: “changing readily; shifting; not fixed, stable, or rigid”
For example, literature is the product of multiple revisions. An author doesn’t just write something straight through and sends it to a publishing company where it’s immediately published without initially being looked over. Instead, the author might start with an idea of what he wants to write, but as he is, he makes subtle changes here and there, or might even completely scrap his idea and start with another one. An author’s ideas are always shifting which influences the product (a book). Once sent to a publishing company, they almost always tend to make revisions also

Works that “capture the reading public’s imagination” also tend to get re-made
For example, Charles Dickens’s, “ A Christmas Carol” has been re-made multiple times film-wise, distinguishing itself from its literary form.

“Work” is often seen as a product of a type of labor. Instead, in this sense, “work” is the “energy that flows through texts, bringing them to life and giving them an afterlife in the many derivative texts that flow from them”

However, some texts “reveal their fluidities more or less fully than others.” This can clearly be seen when there is a typescript or manuscript that show evidence of the changes the author has made
**This can be seen in Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”
