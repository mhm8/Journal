Thoughts on Creating Practice Timeline for James Gleick's The Information:

For this upcoming assignment (due Tuesday 4/7), I gave myself enough time beforehand to work on it in case I ran into any obstacles along the way and needed guidance. I like to think of myself as a minimal technology user. Growing up in the 21st century, I've easily been accustomed to the new technological advances that have sprung up during the course of my childhood. That being said, I've quickly learned to navigate these various technologies, including knowing my way about my iPhone and MAC which I use on an everyday basis. However, coming in and adapting to the various computing strategies this class is composed of was definitely new, and scary for me. I hate the feeling of not knowing what is going on, which has happened a lot during this class so far. But, I'm learning how to be comfortable with my lack of knowledge regarding this course and the various technologies it utilizes. 

When I read the criteria for this assignment, I was initally very nervous. But, despite being hesitant, I trusted my instincts and the list of steps that Professor Schacht had laid out for us to follow. It was definitely a new experience for me. I had never heard about TimelineJS to begin with, but I realized the steps it laid out for me to publish and generate my own timeline wasn't so difficult, especially since Google Spreadsheets was involved in which I was familiar with. I've seen and read timelines before, but it was very interesting to make one by myself, and see the finished product when typing in the URL. This particular assignment helped me appreciate this course more, and even helped boost my confidence in working with stuff that I'm not familiar with.
